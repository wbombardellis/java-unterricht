	\section{Task}
	Use your creativity to extend any of the exercises below (from class 5). Choose only one exercise.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Write a program that composes a melody of 10 notes using the chromatic scale and reproduces it in 60bpm.
		\item Write a program that makes a 2D drawing of the models of the Hydrogen and Helium atoms at the screen.
	\end{itemize}
	To build a valid extension you need to write some extra lines of code, and not only change values, and you need to add some new feature to the program. Examples:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Make the music composition more complex, using different time signatures or asking the user with desired parameters.
		\item Draw models of other atoms at the screen.
	\end{itemize}
	Tip:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item If you are going for a complex feature or plan to add several features, implement it one-by-one and ensure you have a good-working version between each step.
	\end{itemize}

	\section{Groups}
	You may work in pairs or alone.
	
	\section{Delivery}
	Until November, 8th, 2019 23:59, via e-mail wbombardellis@gmail.com. A zip file containing the Netbeans project with the source-code (.java files). The zip file's name must contain your first and last names.

	\section{Evaluation}
	The grade will be given using the following schema:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item 70\% Code correctness: Compiles and runs correctly.
		\item 20\% Creativity: Added features
		\item 10\% Presentation: Code organization/ indentation
	\end{itemize}
	\par \par
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Plagiarism implies invalid solution.
		\item Late delivery implies that you get only 70\% of the grade.
	\end{itemize}
